Course planner is a web app for planning upper secondary school courses in Finland. It works with data from Wilma, the system used in most finnish schools. Try it at [https://courses.jusola.xyz](https://courses.jusola.xyz).

Course planner is based on VueJS, a fairly new progressive JS framework. It also uses Buefy, an UI library for Vue. Features include selecting courses for a specific year and then assigning them to periods. Course selections can be synced with Google and exported in PDF format. The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/juusolain/course-planner).
